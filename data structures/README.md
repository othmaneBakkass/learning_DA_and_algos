# Why Data Structures ?
Data structures are fundamental in any programming language as they help to organize and manage data efficiently during execution of a program. Some key reasons for using data structures are:
1. Efficient Management of Data
2. Ease of usage, and reducing complexity that the developer has to deal with.
3. Cleaner and more readable code

# What is a Data structure ?

A data structure is a way of _organizing_ and _managing_ data while keeping in mind their **relationship** to each other and what operations can be performed on them.

Some common data structures are: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs etc.
data structures can be classified into **Linear** and **Non-Linear** data structures.

## Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures stores values in a linear order or in a sequence. so that the value can be linked to it **predecessor** and **successor**.

Some common linear data structures are: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
Linear Data structures can be split into two categories: 

- **Static data structure**:
Static data structure has a fixed memory size Like an _array_. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
- **Dynamic data structure**:
Dynamic data structure doesn't have a fixed size. which let it be randomly updated during runtime.

## Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures *don't store values in a linear order*.
and we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only.

Examples of non-linear data structures are **trees** and **graphs**.
